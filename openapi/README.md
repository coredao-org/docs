# Introduction

CoreScan is the official blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for CORE Chain. As a means to provide equitable access to blockchain data, we've developed the CoreScan Open APIs to empower developers with direct access to CoreScan's block explorer data and services via GET/POST requests. CoreScan's APIs are provided as a community service and without warranty, so please use what you need and no more.

## API Endpoints

Your app may need to show a user's CORE balance, check the transaction history of an address 🔍 or get the latest information about a new token and its price 💰 For that you may find a suitable endpoint from our wide range of APIs that you can simply query to provide data while you remain fully focused on building your applications.

## Tutorials

There is an overwhelming amount of data 📈 that can be extracted from the CORE Chain. We've helped you take the first steps by writing some thorough tutorials on how to query and derive popular blockchain metrics. For power users, we've also added guides such as how you can programmatically verify contracts through API calls and more advanced use cases of endpoints.
