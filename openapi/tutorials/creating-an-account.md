# Creating an Account

Having a CoreScan account allows you to use sign-in only features and tools such as Address Watch List, Txn Private Notes, Token Ignore List and your very own API keys 🗝.

> Note that creating a CoreScan account is only linked to CoreScan's block explorer services, it is not the same as creating a [CORE Chain address](https://info.etherscan.com/what-is-an-ethereum-address/) 💡

***

## Register an Account

Head over to the [Account Registration](https://scan.coredao.org/register) page and provide username, email and password for your account.

## Verify Your Email

A confirmation link 🔗 will be sent to your email address to verify your sign up request. Once you've clicked on the link, your account set-up process is complete and you may start to use your account-specific features ! 🎉

## Using Your Account

Upon signing in, you will have access to your account dashboard where you can make full use of CoreScan's features such as generating API keys 🗝, hiding unwanted tokens and adding private notes.
