# CoreScan Open API

We've developed the CoreScan Open API to give developers direct access to CoreScan's block explorer data and services. CoreScan's APIs are provided as a community service and without warranty, so please use what you need and no more.

Check out the full API docs available [here](https://docs.coredao.org/api/).

## API Endpoints

CoreScan Open API provides endpoints for many things, including interacting with deployed smart contracts, fetching a user's CORE balance, and viewing detailed information about transactions.
