# Getting Started

Core is a layer 1 blockchain built around a unique consensus mechanism called ["Satoshi Plus"](https://docs.coredao.org/core-white-paper-v1.0.5/satoshi-plus-consensus).&#x20;

In these docs, you'll find information on how to set up an account, access the Core API, use the testnet, build dApps, and much more!
